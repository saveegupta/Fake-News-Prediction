# Fake News Detection

# Overview

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. It utilizes text classification to differentiate between real and fake news articles.

# Dataset

Two datasets are used:

True.csv - Contains real news articles.

Fake.csv - Contains fake news articles.
Each dataset is labeled accordingly to train the model.

# Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

# Usage

Load the datasets and preprocess the text.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a machine learning model to classify news articles.

Evaluate the model performance using accuracy and classification reports.

# Model

The project implements machine learning models using scikit-learn to classify news articles based on text features.

# Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# License

This project is open-source and free to use for educational and research purposes.
